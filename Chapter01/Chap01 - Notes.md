# Introduction to Algorithms (Third Ed.)
## Chapter 1 - The Role of the Algorithms

Questions to Ask
- What are algorithms?
- Why is the study of algorihms worthwhile?
- What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers?

### 1.1 Algoirthms
Algorithms: takes inputs (values) and produces outputs.

Computational Problem: Is a problem that can be solved by computer using a step by step process.

Algorithms are tools to solve a well-specified computational problem.

#### Sorting Problem
- Input: A squence of *n* numbers, 
- Output: A permutation (reordering) of the input such that the set is in a relationship with the precedding elements.
- Sorting problem must have a *correct* solution and must *solve* the problem.

### 1.2 Algorithms as a Technology
- Technology: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially industry.
- Note: Need to demonstrate that your solution method terminates and does so with the correct answer.
- Remember: Computers maybe fast, but are not infinitely fast. Memory maybe inexpensive, but not free.

#### Efficiency
- Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem differ dramatically in their efficiency. These differences can be much more significatn thant differences due to hardware and software.
